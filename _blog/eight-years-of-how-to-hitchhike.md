8 years ago, I wrote _Rules of Thumb: How to Hitchhike and Live on the Road_. I was 24 at the time, and had been hitch-hiking across America and Europe since my late teens. I wrote the book because I was struck by how different the common perception of hitch-hiking was to the reality I experienced. Hitch-hiking in popular culture is a precursor to a grisly death. But it was the most fun I knew how to have. And not just me - I met multitudes of other hitch-hikers from all walks of life who were able to live and travel for very little money.

The world has changed a lot since I wrote the book. Society more divided, weather more extreme, transport more expensive, work harder to find. The perils of travel seem greater than ever. Sadly, someone turning 18 today probably doesn't have the same opportunities that I did.

But could, from this barran soil, a hitch-hiking renaissance spring?

The resistence is the same as it always was: a fear of strangers, a fear of discomfort, a fear of not arriving (or perhaps not even getting that first ride) - in essence, all fears of the unknown. But there is a new necessity: cheap travel isn't so cheap any more. Destinations that were once exotic and adventurous have become overwhelmed by churning crowds of tourists who seek instagrammable moments over authentic experience.

Hitch-hiking offers something rare and precious in our modern world: an unbeaten path. A chance to become truly immersed in the places through which you travel; a chance to see through the eyes of the locals, and share in their culture as equals; and often, it's a chance to give something in return - the comfort of good company - perhaps even a lifetime of friendship.

## Making the world a better place, one ride at a time

Hitch-hiking brings us together. A good ride renews faith in humanity for all who shared in it. I firmly believe that a world with more hitching is a better world overall.

But for those who've never hitch-hiked before, it's a daunting task, and one that can easily go wrong.

That's why I wrote _Rules of Thumb_ all those years ago. You can buy it in paperback or on kindle but, from day one, I've given away a pdf version of the book for free. And as of today, I'm now distributing the full text on this open-source website for easier reading, sharing, and learning. My intention isn't to make money, but to share the knowledge I've gained as effectively as possible to as many people as possible.

## A platform for diverse voices

Everyone can hitch.

I want this website to be a platform that amplifies the voices of people from every background, an inspiration to those who would otherwise limit themselves in the belief they're missing some important quality that would allow them to hitch-hike and live on the road.

If you have a story you want to tell, or advice you want to give, or even counterarguments to the content of this website, please get in touch. I'd love to publish your articles, link to your blog, app, book, podcast, or whatever other content you're producing to encourage others to travel safely, meaningfully, and with little to no money.

## An ongoing project

Much of the content of _Rules of Thumb_ is out-dated. I'll be continuously re-writing chapters with advice that better fits the challenges and opportunities of today's hitch-hikers, as well as writing new articles with advice on areas that weren't previously covered. If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism, please get in touch.

Until then, I'll end this introduction the same way I ended the book:

A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single thumb.

Good luck!
